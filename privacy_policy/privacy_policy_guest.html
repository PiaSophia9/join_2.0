              or destructionPseudonymization (Art. 4 No. 5 GDPR) Pseudonymization includes the processing of personal data in such a way that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a

              ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person. Controller (Art. 4 No. 7 DSGVO). The controller is the natural or legal person, public
              authority, agency or other body which alone or jointly with others determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing
              are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its designation may be provided for under Union or Member State law.

            <h3>3. Legal basis of processing</h3>
            <p>
              For each processing described within our Privacy Policy, we will inform you of the corresponding legal basis on which the processing is carried out. A distinction is made here between
              the following groups of cases where processing is lawful: You have given us consent to process the personal data concerning you for one or more specific purposes (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. a
              DSGVO). There is a contract between you and us for the performance of which the processing is carried out or the processing is necessary for the performance of pre-contractual measures
              which are carried out at your request (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. b DSGVO). The fulfillment of a legal obligation to which we are subject requires the processing (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit.
              c DSGVO). The protection of vital interests of you or another natural person require processing (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. d DSGVO). The performance of a task assigned to us in the public
              interest or the exercise of official authority require processing (Art. 6 (1) p. 1 lit. e DSGVO). The necessity of processing to protect our legitimate interests or those of a third
              party, unless your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms, which require the protection of personal data, override (Art. 6 para. 1 p. 1 lit. f DSGVO).
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>4. Storage of data / deletion of data</h3>
            <p>
              Within the processing described in our privacy policy, we will inform you of the corresponding storage period or the times of deletion or blocking of data. If no explicit storage period
              is defined, the data will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose or legal basis for the storage is no longer given. Storage may take place beyond the defined periods if legal
              regulations to which we are subject (e.g. § 147 AO, § 247 HGB) stipulate a different storage period. Following the storage period, the personal data will be deleted or blocked unless
              further storage is required by us on a legal basis. In addition, storage beyond the specified period is possible in the event of a (possible) legal dispute with you or other legal
              proceedings.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <h3>5. Passing on of personal data</h3>
            <p>
              If your personal data is passed on, you will be informed accordingly at the relevant point in our data protection declaration. If your personal data is transferred outside the European
              Economic Area and thus to so-called third countries, you will be informed accordingly at the relevant point in our data protection declaration. In principle, we will only transfer
              personal data to third countries where an adequate level of protection has been confirmed by the EU Commission or where we can ensure careful handling of the personal data on the basis
              of contractual agreements or other suitable guarantees.

              Right to data portability according to Art. 20 DSGVO You have the right to obtain from us the personal data concerning you in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, as

            <p>
              In addition to the aforementioned rights, you also have the right to object at any time with future effect to the processing of your personal data which is carried out on the basis of

              interests on our part (Article 6 (1) sentence 1 lit. f DSGVO), provided that there are grounds for doing so which arise from your particular situation. In the event of an objection, no
              further processing of the personal data will be carried out unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms,
              or the processing serves to assert, exercise or defend legal claims. In the case of processing of your personal data for the purpose of direct marketing or profiling, where there is a
              link to direct marketing, you have a general right to object without having to provide reasons based on your particular situation. In the event of an objection, we will immediately cease
              processing the personal data for these purposes. To exercise your right of revocation or objection, simply send an e-mail to: mail@sophia-brouwers.de

            <p class="margin_bottom">
              This website uses the encryption and communication protocol TLS 1.3 (Transport Layer Security). Through the TLS certificate used by us and issued by a certification authority, we enable
              an encrypted data exchange between web browser and web server, whereby sensitive data can not be read by third parties. We use the procedure with the highest encryption level that your
              browser supports, which is usually 256-bit encryption. The higher the bit number, the longer the key and the better the protection against third parties.
